scala-readability
=================

This project is about empirically finding out what makes Scala code easier or
harder to read.

Compiling the plugin
--------------------

1. Get [(x)sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt).
2. Run `sbt`. From there run `compile` and `script`.
3. The step above generates a Bash script `scalac-readability` that depends only on Java.
